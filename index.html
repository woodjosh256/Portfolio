                <p>
                    I’m a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville studying software engineering who has
                    developed mobile and desktop applications for private companies as a freelancer. Through my
                    coursework, personal projects, and professional projects, I’ve learned how to develop readable and
                    reliable code that is structured to accommodate future changes. I am most experienced with Java,
                    having used it for several class projects, including an Android app and a Pokemon-esque game AI that
                    implemented the minimax algorithm. Most notably, I’ve used Java, with JavaFX, to develop a desktop
                    data visualization application for Golden Calf Company. I also have experience with JavaScript and
                    front-end, which I used when developing mobile apps for Milk Products Inc. While working with these
                    companies, I’ve learned how to understand and communicate software requirements, especially with
                    people who don’t have a software background.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Outside of programming, I love spending time outdoors hiking and mountain biking. Last spring, I
                    spent 4 months thru hiking the entire Appalachian Trail, trekking 2,192 miles from Georgia to Maine.
                    Challenging myself athletically and connecting through nature in outdoor pursuits is an important
                    part of my life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Throughout high school and during the summer of 2020, I worked as a manager for a McDonald’s in my
                    hometown. In that position, I lead and trained people of a wide variety of ages and backgrounds. I
                    also communicated with customers frequently and was responsible for ensuring customers were
                    satisfied whenever they had any issues. I’ve continued to use the leadership and communication
                    skills I developed while working there as the event coordinator for my university’s outdoors club.
                    In this position, I am responsible for planning and guiding weekly camping, climbing, and paddling
                    trips.

                <h3>Calf Hero</h3>
                <p>
                    Calf Hero is a piece of software I developed for Golden Calf Company that is used to analyze how
                    their colostrum pasteurizers are performing. The program will take a record of the pasteurizer’s
                    sensor measurements over time as an input (in the form of a large CSV file). It will then decode
                    the input and output sensor measurements over time on an interactive interface.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For this project I used Java with JavaFX for the GUI. This project was one of the first times I had
                    to deal with improving program performance. Since the CSV files would frequently contain more than
                    10,000 data points, the application would often take 10+ seconds to read and display each file and
                    there would be a visible lag when interacting with the graph. This wasn’t acceptable since the user
                    needed to be able to quickly switch through many files to scan for issues. Over time I was able to
                    resolve these performance issues by learning more in depth how JavaFX’s plotting worked and using
                    data structures that had lower time complexities for my use case. I also made the program cache
                    other files in the same folder, so that the user could switch between them with no delay.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Overall, this project turned out to be a lot more complex than I had anticipated. However, I found
                    it rewarding to work through many types of issues I hadn’t encountered before and was able learned
                    a lot about Java in the process. I also gained valuable experience communicating software
                    requirements with clients so that I could meet their expectations.

                <p>
                    NRC calculator is an app I created for Animix and Milk Products (a division of Land O’Lakes). The
                    program uses a model developed by the National Research Council to estimate average daily weight
                    gain for a dairy calf based on a variety of inputs. This information helps farmers decide what they
                    should feed their calves.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I created this project using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Adobe Phonegap. The app allows the user to
                    compare multiple feeding plans and supports 6 languages as well as metric or imperial measurements.
                    The NRC Calculator is currently used by over a thousand farmers in multiple countries around the
                    world.

                    Whole Milk Calculator is another app I created with Milk Products that is used to help farmers
                    effectively feed their calves. It was programmed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Adobe PhoneGap.
                    This was my first paid programming project, as well as my first experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

                <h3>The Journey of Bella Shores</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a game that I developed for a game jam run by Repl.it (a game jam is a competition in which
                    one develops a game that is related to a theme within a short period of time). Over about a month I
                    created the game’s art, wrote the game’s story, and programmed it in Python (using Pygame for
                    graphics). The most difficult parts of this project involved creating an engine that could manage
                    each boat’s physics and collisions, making a system for displaying the UI elements, and figuring out
                    how to randomly generate the map. If I were to do this project again, I would focus on improving the
                    boat combat to make it require more skill. Due to the time constraints of the competition I had to
                    focus more on the game’s technical aspects, and didn’t do much to make sure the game required skill
                    and was fun to play.

                <h3>Poe - The Autonomous Poet</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a smaller project that I completed for an AI-themed code jam run by Repl.it (a code jam is
                    a competition where one designs a program about a theme within a short period of time). The program
                    reads a large text (usually a long book) to find which words commonly follow other words. It then
                    attempts to use what it learned from the texts it read and the Datamuse API to make a sonnet or
                    haiku about a certain theme with a Markov Chain algorithm. The poems the program writes never make
                    any sense but reading what it makes can illustrate the writing style of the texts it read. This
                    rogram didn't place in the competition but was listed as an honorable mention. The program can be
                    tested below.

                    This simple game was the first app I ever made, as well as my first project in Java. I made it mainly
                    for fun and to learn about Android development. The game tests your reaction time by having you tap
                    circles at specific times and trying to go as long as possible without making a mistake. My
                    programming skills have improved since I made the app, so if I were to continue this project, I
                    would structure the project differently to better allow for future changes. Also, if I were to
                    continue working on this project, I would improve its page on Google Play to attract more users,
                    since the app has been online for a couple of years now and only has about 160 downloads.
